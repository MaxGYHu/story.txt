There is King in the Jerusalem, we do not know his name yet, so we call him The King. The King is capable of wisdon and courage, and he has a great opportunity to become an irreplaceable ruler given by that. However, he has a huge weakness, in which he is suffering from the leper. Even though he is a majestic and belove king, as a leper, he has no choice but leave his people. As a result, he is on the travel alone. 

In his travels he meets 3 different animals, the first being a dog. This wasnt any normal dog, this dog could speak and went by the name of Brian Griffin. Brian helped guide the king through the lost forest. Brian then parted ways because he did not want to continue through the giant river that was next of the journey. Luckily, the narwhal from Elf helped the king cross the river with ease and Winnie the Pooh met him at the other side. Winnie was very kind to the king and helped guide him to the last leg of the journey which was far more challenging than everything preceeding it.
